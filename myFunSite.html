				Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe scored 28 points apiece to pace Milwaukee past Sacramento 123-111 on Monday night as the Bucks won without new father Antetokounmpo.
				
				Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, missed the game after he and his girlfriend welcomed their first child, which he announced earlier Monday on his Twitter account.
				
				"They are a good team. They are very balanced, they play a really good system," said Kings guard Buddy Hield. "Bledsoe leading the charge tonight, him and Middleton. Giannis was out, but those guys were able to get going. They are tough covers. We got to do a better job just containing them and making things uncomfortable for them but we didn't do that and in the third and fourth quarter and they got it going. "
				
				Milwaukee trailed 90-88 after three quarters, but opened the final period with 13 consecutive points as Sacramento missed its first five shots. Bledsoe capped the run with back-to-back 3 pointers to put the Bucks up 101-90.
				
				"We were saying going into the fourth, whoever starts playing defense, starts getting stops is going to take the game away," Bucks center Brook Lopez said. "That's what that group did who was out there at the beginning of fourth. It fueled us and we continued to ride on that through the whole fourth quarter."</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h3>Bulls vs Wizards</h3>
		<p>The Washington Wizards and Chicago Bulls remain in pursuit of the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot entering Tuesday's game at Capital One Arena, but reaching postseason position likely will require the ability to conquer a struggle that has plagued both teams this season.

			Finishing games.
			
			Washington led visiting Memphis by 12 points Sunday and had a five-point edge entering the fourth quarter. That advantage quickly evaporated as the Wizards shot 4-for-25 (15.4 percent) in the fourth quarter while the Grizzlies closed the game on a 22-8 run en route to a 106-99 win.
			
			"Sometimes we come down and we can't get stops, and we can't make shots either," Washington guard Bradley Beal, who led the Wizards with 26 points, told reporters after the game. "So, it's like something's got to give."
			
			On Sunday, that something sure wasn't Grizzlies rookie sensation Ja Morant, who scored 10 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter and finished with his first career triple-double.
			
			"I think Ja Morant just took it over in the end," Wizards forward Davis Bertans said. "We didn't stop him."
			
			The Wizards and Bulls sit in ninth and 10th place, respectively, but are headed in opposite directions as the All-Star break looms. While Washington has won three of five, Chicago is on a five-game losing streak, one defeat away from matching a season-high skid.</p>
